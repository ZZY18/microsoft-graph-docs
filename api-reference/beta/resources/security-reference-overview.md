# Use the Microsoft Graph API for security threat detection and protection (preview)

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The sophistication of security threats continues to escalate, affecting the global economy. Damage is often done long before organizations even discover it. You can use Microsoft Graph to build or extend security solutions that consolidate and correlate security alerts from multiple sources, detect threats that attempt to compromise user identity, unlock contextual data to inform investigations, and automate security operations for greater efficiency.

Intelligent Security Graph brings together security intelligence from within Microsoft, security operations centers, and partners from around the world to form an ecosystem of integrated security solutions. Using machine learning, behavioral monitoring, and the scale of the cloud, the Intelligent Security Graph can better protect, detect, and respond to threats quickly and comprehensively. The [security API](security-api-overview.md) connects you to the [Intelligent Security Graph](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/intelligence-security-api), empowering you with solutions that are actionable and holistic.

The [identity protection risk events API](identityprotection-root.md) gives easy access for Azure AD Premium P1 and P2 customers to query [risk detections made by Identity Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-identityprotection-graph-getting-started) and use those events in SIEM systems and security applications.
